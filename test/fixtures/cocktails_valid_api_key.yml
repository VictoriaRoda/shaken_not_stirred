      string: '[{"id":270,"name":"Vodka Martini","description":"A vodka martini, also
        known as a vodkatini or kangaroo cocktail, is a cocktail made with vodka and
        vermouth, a variation of a martini. A vodka martini is made by combining vodka,
        dry vermouth and ice in a cocktail shaker or mixing glass. The ingredients
        are chilled, either by stirring or shaking, then strained and served \"straight
        up\" (without ice) in a chilled cocktail glass.  The drink may be garnished
        with an olive, a \"twist\" (a strip of lemon peel squeezed or twisted), capers,
        or cocktail onions (with the onion garnish specifically yielding a vodka Gibson).
        The vodka martini has become a common and popular cocktail. Some purists maintain
        that, while it is a perfectly fine drink, it is not a true martini; which
        is traditionally made with gin.","ingredients":["6 cl (6 parts) vodka","1
